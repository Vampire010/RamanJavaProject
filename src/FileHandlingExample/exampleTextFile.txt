It’s National Joke Day, and your cheesy, mostly funny Assistant has a few jokes up its sleeve. Here are a couple of our favorites:

You: “Ok Google, tell me a joke.”
Google Assistant: “One joke, coming up! What is a sea monster’s favorite snack? Ships and dip.” 🛳
Not your speed? What about…

You: “Ok Google, tell me a joke.”
Google Assistant: “This might make you laugh. How do robots eat guacamole? With computer chips.”
So head outside—“Ok Google, comedy shows nearby”—or take a seat—“Ok Google, tell me a joke”—and cue the laugh track
